# JournalForge Code of Conduct

## Introduction

JournalForge is an innovative journaling platform that combines personal writing with AI-powered content generation. We aim to create a community where all users, contributors, and developers feel welcome, respected, and appreciated. Whether you’re contributing code, reporting an issue, or suggesting features, we expect everyone to uphold the community standards outlined below.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone involved in the JournalForge project. By participating in this community, you agree to respect others and foster a positive and constructive atmosphere.

## Our Values

1. **Respect and Kindness**  
   Treat everyone with respect and empathy. Harassment, exclusion, and offensive language or behavior are not tolerated. We value a community where all individuals, regardless of their background or identity, are welcome to contribute and interact.

2. **Collaboration and Support**  
   Collaboration is key to improving JournalForge. If you encounter an issue or need assistance, feel free to reach out to others for help. In turn, offer help when possible, and encourage the exchange of ideas to foster learning and development.

3. **Constructive Feedback**  
   Constructive feedback is a foundation of growth. When giving or receiving feedback, be respectful and open-minded. We believe that thoughtful discussions and positive criticism lead to better outcomes for the project.

4. **Inclusivity and Diversity**  
   We welcome contributors from all backgrounds and skill levels. JournalForge is a space for diverse opinions, and everyone should feel empowered to contribute, learn, and share without fear of discrimination or exclusion.

5. **Professionalism**  
   Maintain professionalism in all forms of communication, whether through issues, pull requests, or direct messages. Be mindful of your tone and ensure that your interactions are respectful and polite.

## Expected Behavior

- Treat everyone with kindness and respect.
- Embrace diverse perspectives and experiences.
- Offer and receive constructive criticism with an open mind.
- Focus on making the project and community better for everyone.
- Be patient and supportive of others, particularly newcomers.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment or discrimination of any kind.
- Personal attacks, trolling, or inappropriate behavior.
- Use of offensive or sexualized language or imagery.
- Disrupting the community or project contributions in any form.
- Threatening, intimidating, or bullying behavior.

## Spammy PR Rules

To ensure high-quality contributions, JournalForge has guidelines to prevent spammy pull requests (PRs):

- PRs must be associated with an open issue. PRs submitted without a corresponding issue may be considered spam.
- Avoid trivial or minor changes unless they meaningfully improve the project.
- Contributions for Hacktoberfest should focus on solving substantial issues rather than superficial changes.
- Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the PR being marked as spam after consultation with the contributor.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to the project maintainers. Reports will be handled confidentially and with care.

We are committed to addressing any issues to ensure a safe, inclusive environment for all.

## Enforcement

Contributors who violate this Code of Conduct may face actions deemed appropriate by the project leadership, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from the project.

## Conclusion

By contributing to JournalForge, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. Let’s work together to create a positive, inclusive, and productive environment where everyone can thrive and contribute meaningfully.
